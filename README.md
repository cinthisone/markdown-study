# Zip Markdown Viewer

A fast, offline-friendly, mobile-ready web app to browse and read Markdown files from a .zip archive. Features KaTeX math, syntax-highlighted code, and dark mode.

## Motivation

This project was created to provide a centralized place for storing and organizing study notes for data engineering and quantitative development work. Markdown was chosen as the primary format because it excels at handling both code snippets and mathematical formulas, making it perfect for technical documentation and learning materials.

## Features

- **Folder tree navigation** (unlimited nesting)
- **GitHub-flavored Markdown** (tables, task-lists)
- **KaTeX math** ($...$, $$...$$)
- **highlight.js** for code blocks (auto-detect)
- **Dark/light mode** (default: dark, persists)
- **Hash-based routing** (deep-link to any file)
- **Offline support** (stores files in IndexedDB)
- **No backend, no auth, no DB**
